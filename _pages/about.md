👨‍🎓I am a doctoral researcher in the field of social sciences at the University of Helsinki. My research is focused on the interplay between population ageing, labour market changes, and social welfare policies. 

Specifically, I am interested in exploring questions related to the impact of labour market changes on retirement, including the effects of massive layoffs on older workers, the evolution of retirement policies within the context of labour market transformations, and the impact of digitalization on work. To examine these multifaceted topics, I employ a triple-component attitude model and employ novel quantitative and qualitative research methods.
