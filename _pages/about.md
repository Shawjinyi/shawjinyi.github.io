👨‍🎓I am a doctoral researcher in the field of social sciences at the University of Helsinki. My research is focused on the interplay between population ageing, labour market changes, and social welfare policies. Specifically, I am interested in exploring questions related to the impact of labour market changes on retirement, including the effects of massive layoffs on older workers, the evolution of retirement policies within the context of labour market transformations, and the impact of digitalization on work. To examine these multifaceted topics, I employ a triple-component attitude model and employ novel quantitative and qualitative research methods. 

I hold an M.Sc in Management from the University of Liverpool, where my research focused on the fields of human resource management and industrial relations. My current research project is an ongoing study of the retirement plans of older employees who have survived layoffs in China. By analyzing this data, I aim to provide new perspectives on welfare policy and to offer insights into the complex modern labour market. I am also an experienced project management officer with work experience in Africa national projects.
